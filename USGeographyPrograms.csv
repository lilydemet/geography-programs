"This dataset lists  U.S. institutions of higher education that offer a degree in geography )or geography in combination with one or more subjects) as of 2021. No distinction is made between public and private institutions, or between community colleges and institutions offering four year degrees. An initial list of such institutions of higher education was retrieved from the Interactive Map of the 2020 AAG Guide to Geography Programs in the Americas (cite). The following data were manually gathered from institutional websites: institution name, department name, administrative unit, and degree(s) offered by level and type. Degrees in applied geography were counted. For example, a Master of Arts in Applied Geography was entered as a Master of Arts (MA) degree. Degrees solely in geographic information science were not recorded, although degrees in geographical science were allowed. Department name was left null where only a program in geography existed with the exception of Clark Graduate School of Geography, which was treated as a formal Department of Geography. Along with department name, two additional fields were created. The first indicated whether or not “geography” was included in the department name and the second indicated whether or not the department was specifically a Department of Geography. In instances where degree, department, or administrative unit was ambiguous, institutions were telephoned or e-mailed to verify directory information. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
